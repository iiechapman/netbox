This is a test I did to learn how SDL_net works. I created a "Tron Cycle" style game that plays over the net.

In order to play you need to start one instance of the game and choose to run it as a server. Then clients run the game and choose to play as a client, and enter in the servers IP address.

This game works on a fundamental level, however there are a few bugs, most of which have to do with how logging in and out of a game effects the state of the server.
